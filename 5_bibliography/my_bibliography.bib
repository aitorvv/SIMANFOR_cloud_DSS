	abstract = {{\textbackslash}textlessp{\textbackslash}textgreaterAn individual-tree height\&\#150;diameter model was developed for stone pine (Pinus pinea L.) in Spain. Five biparametric nonlinear equations were fitted and evaluated based on a data set consisting of 8614 trees from 455 plots located in the four most important regions where the species occurs in Spain. Because of the problem of high correlation among observations taken from the same sampling unit, a mixed-model approach, including random coefficients, is proposed. Several stand variables, such as density, dominant height, or diametric distribution percentiles, were included in the model as covariates to explain among plot variability. To determine interregional variability among the regions studied, regional effects were included in the model using fixed dummy variables. Two models, one for inland regions and one for coastal regions, were found to be sufficient to explain regional variability in the height\&\#150;diameter relationship for the species in Spain. Mixed models allow predictive role in two ways: a typical response, including only fixed effects, and a calibrated response, where random effects are predicted and included in the model from the prior measurement of the height in a subsample of trees. Different alternatives were tested to determine optimum subsample size. Measurement of the height of the 20\% largest trees in the plot has been shown to be a useful approach.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater},

	abstract = {{\textbackslash}textlessp{\textbackslash}textgreater Adapting forests to climate change is a critical issue for forest management. It requires an understanding of climate effects on forest systems and the ability to forecast how these effects may change over time. We used Spanish Second National Forest Inventory data and the SIMANFOR platform to simulate the evolution of CO ₂ stock (CO ₂ Mg · ha $^{\textrm{−1}}$ ) and accumulation rates (CO ₂ Mg · ha $^{\textrm{−1}}$ · year $^{\textrm{−1}}$ ) for the 2000–2100 period in pure and mixed stands managed under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) in Spain. We hypothesized that (1) the more optimistic climate scenarios (SSP1 {\textbackslash}textgreater {\textbackslash}textgreater SSP5) would have higher CO ₂ stock and accumulation rates; (2) mixed stands would have higher CO ₂ stock and accumulation rates than pure stands; and (3) the behavior of both variables would vary based on forest composition (conifer–conifer vs. conifer–broadleaf). We focused on {\textbackslash}textlessitalic{\textbackslash}textgreaterPinus sylvestris{\textbackslash}textless/italic{\textbackslash}textgreater L., and its main mixtures with {\textbackslash}textlessitalic{\textbackslash}textgreaterPinus nigra{\textbackslash}textless/italic{\textbackslash}textgreater , {\textbackslash}textlessitalic{\textbackslash}textgreaterPinus pinaster{\textbackslash}textless/italic{\textbackslash}textgreater , {\textbackslash}textlessitalic{\textbackslash}textgreaterFagus sylvatica{\textbackslash}textless/italic{\textbackslash}textgreater and {\textbackslash}textlessitalic{\textbackslash}textgreaterQuercus pyrenaica{\textbackslash}textless/italic{\textbackslash}textgreater . The SSP scenarios had correlating CO ₂ stock values in which SSP1 {\textbackslash}textgreater SSP2 {\textbackslash}textgreater SSP3 {\textbackslash}textgreater SSP5, ranging from the most optimistic (SSP1) to the most pessimistic (SSP5). Though pure stands had higher CO ₂ stock at the beginning, differences with regard to mixed stands were drastically reduced at the end of the simulation period. We also found an increase in the aboveground CO ₂ proportion compared to belowground in conifer–broadleaf mixtures, while the opposite trend occurred in conifer–conifer mixtures. Overall CO ₂ accumulation rates decreased significantly from the beginning to the end of the simulation period, but our results indicated that this decline would be less drastic in mixed stands than in pure ones. At the end of the simulation period, CO ₂ accumulation rates were higher in mixed stands than in pure stands for all mixtures, fractions (aboveground and belowground) and SSPs. Knowing the evolution of mixed forests in different climate scenarios is relevant for developing useful silvicultural guidelines in the Mediterranean region and optimizing forestry adaptation strategies. Better understanding can also inform the design of management measures for transitioning from pure stands to more resource efficient, resistant and resilient mixed stands, in efforts to reduce forest vulnerability in the face of climate change. This work highlights the importance and benefits of mixed stands in terms of CO ₂ accumulation, stand productivity and species diversity. {\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater},

	abstract = {{\textbackslash}textlessp{\textbackslash}textgreaterLong-term field-data series were used to fit a mushroom productivity model. Simulations enabled us to predict the consequences of management and climate scenarios on potential mushroom productivity. Mushrooms play an important ecological and economic role in forest ecosystems. Human interest in collecting mushrooms for self-consumption is also increasing, giving forests added value for providing recreational services. Pinus pinaster Ait. is a western Mediterranean species of great economic and ecological value. Over 7.5\% of the total European distribution of the species is found on the Castilian Plateau in central Spain, where a great variety of mushrooms can be harvested. The aim of this study was to model and simulate mushroom productivity in Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) ecosystems in northern Spain under different silvicultural and climatic scenarios. A mixed model was fitted that related total mushroom productivity to stand and weather variables. The model was uploaded to the SiManFor platform to study the effect of different silvicultural and climatic scenarios on mushroom productivity. The selected independent variables in the model were the ratio between stand basal area and density as a stand management indicator, along with precipitation and average temperatures for September and November. The simulation results also showed that silviculture had a positive impact on mushroom productivity, which was higher in scenarios with moderate and high thinning intensities. The impact was highly positive in wetter scenarios, though only slightly positive and negative responses were observed in hotter and drier scenarios, respectively. Silviculture had a positive impact on mushroom productivity, especially in wetter scenarios. Precipitation had greater influence than temperature on total mushroom productivity in Maritime pine stands. The results of this paper will enable forest managers to develop optimal management approaches for P. pinaster forests that integrate Non-Wood Forest Products resources.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater},

	abstract = {Forest models predict tree and stand evolution under different scenarios, thereby supporting decision-making in forest management. Models are complex structures composed of sub-models that estimate forest variables at tree and stand levels. Prediction accuracy has generally been evaluated independently of the model. Integrated sub-models make forest models easier to use and provide predictions for growth, survival, ingrowth and many other tree and stand variables with reduced effort. However, while individual submodel validation is widely practiced and normally done by each author individually, joint model validation remains less explored. This study deploys a useful methodology for evaluating and validating models. After comparing observed and predicted data, several case studies were then proposed to improve the accuracy of the joint model. We used the IBERO model, data from the Spanish National Forest Inventory and the SIMANFOR simulator platform. The accuracy of growth submodels was improved by calibrating their equations, though accuracy was not improved in survival and ingrowth submodels.},

	abstract = {Mixed species forests are presently on the advance and widely held to provide many ecosystem functions and services better than pure stands. Recent studies well explored species mixing effects at the individual tree or stand level. However, the link between individual and stand level which is represented by the size-structure dynamics of stands, is still hardly understood.Aim of this study: The objective was to analyse how species mixing modifies the size-structure dynamics of mixed compared with pure forest stands. Area of the study: the study was carried out in Southern Germany.Material and Methods: We selected 11long-term experiments comprising 129 plots of un-thinned or just lightly thinned pure and mixed stands of European beech (Fagus sylvatica [ L.]) and analysed their size structure dynamics.Main Results: Based on the Gini coefficient, skewness and kurtosis we show how mixing with Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) modifies the size-structure dynamics of European beech. The size distribution of beech in mixture mostly lags behind the pure stand, is more size-asymmetric, and the mortality shifts from the smaller diameter classes further to the taller trees than in pure stands.Research highlights: The revealed changes of the size-structure dynamics of beech in mixed versus pure stands result from a modification of both growth partitioning and self-thinning. We draw conclusions of the reduced size growth and size equality of beech in mixed versus pure stands for forest management planning and perspectives for forest research.Keywords: species selection effect; true mixing effect; morphological plasticity; size-distribution; growth partitioning between trees; mode of mortality; European beech (Fagus sylvatica [L.]); Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst); sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.)

However, with global change, monospecific plantations are increasingly vulnerable to abiotic and biotic disturbances. As an adaption measure we need to move to plantations that are more diverse in genotypes, species, and structure, with a design underpinned by science. TreeDivNet, a global network of tree diversity experiments, responds to this need by assessing the advantages and disadvantages of mixed species plantations. The network currently consists of 18 experiments, distributed over 36 sites and five ecoregions. With plantations 1–15 years old, TreeDivNet can already provide relevant data for forest policy and management. In this paper, we highlight some early results on the carbon sequestration and pest resistance potential of more diverse plantations. Finally, suggestions are made for new, innovative experiments in understudied regions to complement the existing network.},

	abstract = {In this review, the unique features and facts of long-term experiments are presented. Long-term experimental plots provide information of forest stand dynamics which cannot be derived from forest inventories or small temporary plots. Most comprise unthinned plots which represent the site specific maximum stand density as an unambiguous reference. By measuring the remaining as well as the removed stand, the survey of long-term experiments provides the total production at a given site, which is most relevant for examining the relationship between site conditions and stand productivity on the one hand and between stand density and productivity on the other. Thus, long-term experiments can reveal the site-specific effect of thinning and species mixing on stand structure, production and carbon sequestration. If they cover an entire rotation or even the previous and following generation on a given site, they reveal a species’ long-term behaviour and any growth trends caused by environmental changes. Second, we exploit the unique data of European long-term experiments, some of which have been surveyed since 1848. We show the long-term effect of different density regimes on stand dynamics and an essential trade-off between total stand volume production and mean tree size. Long-term experiments reveal that tree species mixing can significantly increase stand density and productivity compared with monospecific stands. Thanks to surveys spanning decades or even a century, we can show the changing long-term-performance of different provenances and acceleration of stand production caused by environmental change, as well as better understand the growth dynamics of natural forests. Without long-term experiments forest science and practice would be not in a position to obtain such findings which are of the utmost relevance for science and practice. Third, we draw conclusions and show perspectives regarding the maintenance and further development of long-term experiments. It would require another 150 years to build up a comparable wealth of scientific information, practical knowledge, and teaching and training model examples. Although tempting, long-term experiments should not be sacrificed for cost-cutting measures. Given the global environmental change and the resulting challenges for sustainable management, the network of long-term experiments should rather be extended regarding experimental factors, recorded variables and inter- and transdisciplinary use for science and practice.},

The simulators’ platform, sIMfLOR was recently created to implement different growth models with a common philosophy. The objective was developing one easily-updatable, user-friendly, forest management and climate change sensitive simulator capable of projecting growth for the main tree species in Portugal.Area of the study: Portugal.Material and methods: The new simulator was programmed in a modular form consisting of several modules. The growth module integrates different forest growth and yield models (empirical and process-based) for the main wood production tree species in Portugal (eucalypt, umbrella and maritime pines); whereas the management module drives the growth projections along the planning horizon according to a range of forest management approaches and climate (at present only available for eucalypt).Main results: The main result is the StandsSIM-MD Management Driven simulator that overcomes the limitations of the existing stand level simulators. It is a step forward when compared to the models currently available in the sIMfLOR platform covering more tree species, stand structures and stand compositions. It is focused on end-users and it is based on similar concepts regarding the generation of required inputs and generated outputs.Research highlights:-          Forest Management Driven simulations approach-          Multiple Prescriptions-Per-Stand functionality-          StandsSIM-MD can be used to support landowners decisions on stand forest management-          StandsSIM-MD simulations at regional level can be combined with optimization routinesKeywords: Forest simulator, Forest Management Approaches; StandsSIM-MD; forest management.},

	abstract = {Mixed forests are crucial to climate resilience in Mediterranean ecosystems and show great potential for mitigating the effects of climate change. Proper parameterization and integration of mixed-forest models into simulation platforms open the possibility to explore and assess alternative silvicultural paths. In this study, a climate-sensitive growth model for mixed forests was implemented on SIMANFOR, offering parameterizations for 29 species mixtures including the most frequent in Spain. After describing the model implementation process and its potential applications, a case study is presented to show the mixed-model performance, thus using data from the Spanish Fourth National Forest Inventory (SNFI4) and previously developed silviculture scenarios for Castilla and Leon region (Spain). The case study analysed four different mixtures of Pinus sylvestris with Pinus nigra, Pinus pinaster, Fagus sylvatica, and Quercus pyrenaica, which were selected for their complementarity, productivity, and resource-use efficiency. The results show that thinned mixed stands exhibited higher quadratic mean diameter, biomass and carbon content compared to unthinned stands. The differences observed in biomass and carbon allocation among silvicultural scenarios were consistent in all mixtures. This case study shows how simulations can play a crucial role in understanding the potential of different silvicultural alternatives and in orientating forest management guidelines.},

The new model allows for improved biomass assimilation, partitioning (stem, foliage, root), and losses (root turnover, foliage loss, mortality). Evaluation at field-scale showed that SWAT-3PG can replicate the different forest biomass components for evergreen forests well. Testing for deciduous and mixed forests sites using remote-sensed data showed that the model can simulate leaf area index (LAI), net primary productivity (NPP) and actual evapotranspiration (AET) reasonably well and can be used to constrain SWAT-3PG when lack of field data. Sensitivity analysis of SWAT-3PG showed its potential in evaluating the impacts of management and climate on forested ecosystems. SWAT-3PG can also be of importance to forest managers as it can estimate variables such as plant height, diameter at breast height (DBH), and basal area.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a stand growth model, based on physiological processes, which incorporates a number of steps and procedures that have allowed considerable simplification relative to extant process-based models. The model, called 3-PG (use of Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth), calculates total carbon fixed (gross primary production; PG) from utilizable, absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (φp.a.u.), obtained by correcting the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the forest canopy (φp.a.) for the effects of soil drought, atmospheric vapour pressure deficits and stand age. PG is obtained from φp.a.u. and the canopy quantum efficiency, values of which are becoming available. The ratio of net (PN) to gross primary production is emerging as relatively constant for trees. This eliminates the need to calculate respiration and is used to estimate PN—the net amount of carbon converted to biomass. 3-PG uses a simple relationship to estimate the amount of carbon allocated below ground and a procedure based on allometric ratios—widely available for many species and situations—to determine the allocation of carbon to foliage and stems and constrain tree growth patterns. The effects of nutrition are incorporated through the carbon allocation procedure; the amount of carbon allocated below ground will increase with decreasing soil fertility. Recently acquired knowledge about the physiological factors causing decline in forest growth rates with age is used to model that decline. Changes in stem populations (self-thinning) are derived from a procedure based on the −32 power law, combined with stem growth rates. The model requires weather data as input, works on monthly time steps and has been run for periods up to 120 years, producing realistic patterns of stem growth and stem diameter increments. The time course of leaf area index is realistic for a range of soil conditions and atmospheric constraints. 3-PG can be run from remotely-sensed estimates of leaf area index coupled to weather data and basic, readily available information about soils and stand characteristics. It is being tested as a practical tool against forestry data from New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria and New Zealand. Test results show excellent correspondence between stand growth measurements and simulated stem growth over 30 years.},

In a standard simulation, daily climatic data are analyzed. From the interaction between daily rainfall and the forest structure, the amount of intercepted water by the canopy layer, throughfall and stemflow are estimated. This effective rainfall increases the water stored in the soil which is used by the trees. The proportion of sapwood to heartwood, the leaf area of each tree and, consequently, the leaf area index (LAI) of the forest are all highly dependent on water availability in the model.},

	abstract = {Natural disturbances play a key role in ecosystem dynamics and are important factors for sustainable forest ecosystem management. Quantitative models are frequently employed to tackle the complexities associated with disturbance processes. Here we review the wide variety of approaches to modelling natural disturbances in forest ecosystems, addressing the full spectrum of disturbance modelling from single events to integrated disturbance regimes. We applied a general, process-based framework founded in disturbance ecology to analyze modelling approaches for drought, wind, forest fires, insect pests and ungulate browsing. Modelling approaches were reviewed by disturbance agent and mechanism, and a set of general disturbance modelling concepts was deduced. We found that although the number of disturbance modelling approaches emerging over the last 15 years has increased strongly, statistical concepts for descriptive modelling are still largely prevalent over mechanistic concepts for explanatory and predictive applications. Yet, considering the increasing importance of disturbances for forest dynamics and ecosystem stewardship under anthropogenic climate change, the latter concepts are crucial tool for understanding and coping with change in forest ecosystems. Current challenges for disturbance modelling in forest ecosystems are thus (i) to overcome remaining limits in process understanding, (ii) to further a mechanistic foundation in disturbance modelling, (iii) to integrate multiple disturbance processes in dynamic ecosystem models for decision support in forest management, and (iv) to bring together scaling capabilities across several levels of organization with a representation of system complexity that captures the emergent behaviour of disturbance regimes.},

In this chapter, we provide a review on the state-of-the-art of models simulating mixedwood stands. After reviewing almost 400 peer-reviewed publications, it is clear that most modelling exercises are done for explanatory uses rather than for decision-making support tools. Among them, North America and central Europe are the main model development centers. It is also clear that more model portability is needed, as even the most widely distributed models tend to be used in the same region where they were originally developed. Finally, the four models used more widely for simulating mixed forests stands were identified: two have been applied mostly in boreal/temperate ecosystems (FORECAST and SILVA), whereas the other two have been used in tropical/subtropical environments (FORMIND and FORMIX). A comparison of their different modelling approaches is provided, and multimodel exercises are suggested as a way to both compare model performance and also to reduce simulation uncertainty due to model selection.},

	abstract = {Mixed-species forests can sometimes fulfil forest functions and services better than monocultures and are therefore receiving growing attention in forest science and practice. The productivity of mixtures and the interactions between species are influenced by the availability of different resources and climatic conditions, all of which change spatially and temporally. Models are a valuable tool for understanding and predicting how these interacting factors will influence the growth and other functions and services in mixed-species forests. However, concepts, models and theory are still mainly based on monocultures, which have dominated forest science since its beginnings. Recent empirical works report strong effects of mixing tree species on the environmental conditions within stands (e.g., vertical light profile, rooting space, humus layer), their functioning (e.g., photosynthetic rate, light use, growth), and tree and stand structure (e.g., crown and stem shape, shoot and root morphology). Process-based organ- or tree-level approaches reveal changed resource supply, flows and metabolic rates in high spatial and temporal resolution. Stand-level approaches usually provide predictions with a lower spatial and temporal resolution but can be more accurate in the longer-term. Many studies stress considerable effects of mixing tree species on growth dynamics, yield, resilience and stability, but these effects are still under-represented in existing models. We reviewed 54 forest growth models to show how they incorporate the variability of individual tree or species characteristics that occur in forests and how this variability influences the development and characteristics of the whole stand. While some organ- or tree-level models inherently integrate evident processes, stand-level models do not usually explicitly consider species interactions. Nevertheless, many processes that occur in mixtures can also be modelled at the stand level and are often included in stand-level monospecific models. Stand-level models are likely to offer a simpler alternative model structure for mixtures. We stress how both model approaches can be refined, benefit from mutual adjustment, and can be substantiated by further empirical research into mixed-species forests.},
